Description
-----------

Simple object detection engine based on WaldBoost machine learning algorithm.
The engine can use Local Binary Patterns, Local Rank Patterns, Local Rank
Differences or Haar image features.

src/

classifier.cpp/h    Support for XML classifiers
demo.cpp            Main program
faces.h             Classifier for face detection tranformed to header file
image.c/h           Support stuff
lrd_engine.c/h      Critical part of the detection - implementation of feature extraction and 
simplexml.cpp/h     Some XML support

data/               Example classifiers (for face detection and car detection)


Requirements
------------

OpenCV              Input from camera and image representation
libxml2             XML support
libargtable2        Command line parsing


Examples
--------

demo

The program captures image from camera and detects objects in the image.
Implicit classifier is for face detection (faces.h is used). User can supply
other classifier on command line (e.g. those in the data/ directory).


wbdetect

This program detect objects with given classifier in images supplied as
parameters. For more info see:

    wbdetect --help


Critical parts of the computation
---------------------------------

Functions in lrd_engine.cpp

eval*StageSimple()      Extraction of feature from the image
eval*Classifier()       Evaluation of the classifier
scanImage()             Sliding window scanning on input image
