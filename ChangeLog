	* ALL: Initial version. Code migrated from ABon project and cleaned up.
	All implemented detectors were debuged to produce correct results.
	Supported features are LBP, LRP and LRD.

	* preprocess.cpp: Preprocessing module that unifies access to image data. 

	* core.cpp: Core module with high-level fucnctions and structures.

	* core.cpp: Functions set_classifier_image_size and
	calculate_classifier_ranks merged to prepare_classifier. This is more
	convenient for programmer.

	* core_simple.cpp: Evaluation of classifier on an intensity or integral
	image for reference purposes.

	* core_simple.cpp: Added functions that test if a classifier can be
	evaluated by the intensity and integral scanners.

	* core_sse.cpp: Different versions of detector that uses SSE instructions.

	* core_sse.cpp: Added functions that test if a classifier can be
	evaluated by the lbp, conv_bunch16 and iconv scanners.

	* core_sse.cpp, core_simple.cpp: Value of evaluated stages is _incremented_
	by classification evaluation function. This allows for combining various
	evaluators.

	* lbp.c: Local Binary Patterns operator implemented with SSE.

	* const.cpp: Constants needed for feature evaluation.

	* classifier.cpp: Classifier management - XML processing, expoert to .c
	source, etc.

	* preprocess.cpp: Added PreprocessedPyramid as a support for multi-scale
	object detection.

	* preprocess.cpp: Fixed bug which caused crash during preprocessing -
	inconsistent image sizes of src and dst in convolution.

	* preprocess.cpp (interlieved_convolution): Fixed crash

	* README: Updated with required informations

	* THANKS: Created

	* ./examples: Directory with examples

	* ./benchmark: Benchmark application to compare the lib with OpnCV

	* ./data: Added example classifier for frontal face detection (LBP2x2
	  features, alpha=0.2)

	* structures.h: Converted to C (with typedefs) to allow pure .c static
	  classifiers

	* classifier.cpp (export_classifier_header): Updated to produce correct
	  headers with current version of library.

	* preprocess.cpp (create_pyramid): Added restriction to minimal size of
	  an image.
	
	* preprocess.cpp (insert_image): Fixed bug which caused segfault in cases
	  when the pyramid had less images when defined by octaves and
	  levels_per_octave.
